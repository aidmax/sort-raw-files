# sort-raw-files

This bash script checks if a RAW file contains an XMP sidecar file along with
it and has rating tag higher than XMP_RATING_MIN variable, it creates a new
folder in EDITS_BASE folder, and copies all related files from the original
directory there.

Currently, the script works inside folders with naming fj_####### and gr_#######.
